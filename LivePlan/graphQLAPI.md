# Test implementation

Gosh, I would never want anyone to look at this code for any sort of inspiration, it is really just hacked together. I built it on fairly low-level constructs to better understand what was really going on.

I also left things in a transitional state. I had just done some refactoring, it still compiles but may error on the request, I'm not sure.
